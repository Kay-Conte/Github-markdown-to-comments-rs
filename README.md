# Markdown to Comments

Converts your github markdown to rust doc comments for your docs.rs needs

## Usage

Simply run the program and enter the directory of your github markdown. 

The program will generate an output.txt file with the added comment symbols.

## Additional Notes

This application was thrown together in about 5 seconds because I didn't feel like commenting a ton of lines to convert my github markdown over to my docs.rs page. 

This program should need no future pushes or maintaining though I will add any relevant features if requested.
